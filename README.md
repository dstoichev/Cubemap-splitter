# Cubemap-splitter
A Photoshop script which given a stereoscopc or monoscopic VR cubemap strip gets its building images.

A Cubemap is a collection of six square textures that represent the reflections on an environment. The six squares form the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object; each face represents the view along the directions of the world axes (up, down, left, right, forward and back).

A series of VR Cubemap JPEG files is OPEN in Photoshop.

When we work with stereoscopic Cubemaps we have two collections of six squares, for the left and the right eye respectively.
When we work with monoscopic Cubemaps we have one collection of six squares, for the left eye only.

We need each collection sliced into its building squares. The squares which need it must be flipped horizontally or vertically. 
The groups of JPEG images must be saved into separate folders for the right and the left eye.
We need the result folders placed in one folder which must take the file name of the document.
