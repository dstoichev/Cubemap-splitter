# Cubemap-splitter
A Photoshop script which given a stereoscopc VR cubemap stripe gets its building images.

A series of VR Cubemap JPEG files is OPEN in Photoshop.

A Cubemap is a collection of six square textures that represent the reflections on an environment. The six squares form the faces of an imaginary cube that surrounds an object; each face represents the view along the directions of the world axes (up, down, left, right, forward and back).

We work with stereoscopic Cubemaps, so we have two collections of six squares, for the left and the right eye respectively.

We need the two collections sliced into their building squares. The squares which need it must be flipped horizontally or vertically. 
The two groups of JPEG images must be saved into separate folders for the right and the left eye.
We need the result folders placed in one folder which must take the file name of the document.
